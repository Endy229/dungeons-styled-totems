This resourcepack replaces the models of the Totem of Freezing and Totem of Illusion items from Friends&Foes with those similar to the Totem of Undying from the Dungeons Style resourcepack

You need Friends&Foes mod in order for this resource pack to work! You can download it here: [Forge/Neoforge](https://modrinth.com/mod/friends-and-foes-forge) | [Fabric/Quilt](https://modrinth.com/mod/friends-and-foes)

You can download Dungeons Style [here](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/dungeons-style)

Originally this was made to fix inconsistency in the modpack I made for my friends

I do not own the original item model. I just slightly edited it.
